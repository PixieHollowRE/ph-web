actual path I used
s.dolimg.com/pixiehollow/<insert "game" folder>

This is a (mostly) complete scrape of the pixiehollow "game" folder, there exists a "game2" and "game3" folder all of which have a different version of the game that was used for dev/qa.

A notable missing file which is no longer on the server is "/<game folder>/bundles/config_tools.swf"

The eric.js is used to bypass some of the checks the game does and was found in the zazzle(admin) version of another version of the game.
