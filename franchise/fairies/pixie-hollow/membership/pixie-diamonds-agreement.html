					<div class="msa-text">
					
							<h3>DISNEY FAIRIES PIXIE HOLLOW PIXIE DIAMONDS PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT")</h3>
							<p>
								You have elected to purchase "Pixie Diamonds" (the "<strong>Service</strong>") for use in the Pixie Hollow virtual world (the "<strong>Game</strong>").
							</p>
							<p>
								PLEASE READ THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE DISNEY TERMS OF USE, AND THE DISNEY HOUSE RULES CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SERVICE.
							</p>
							<p>
								This Service is owned and operated by Disney Online (referred to as "<strong>Disney</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>" herein).
							</p>
							<p>
								Please note that the person who purchases the service by credit card or other payment option will be referred to from time to time as 
								"<strong>PURCHASER</strong>" in this Agreement.  The person who receives the Service for their Pixie Hollow registered account (whether free or trial 
								account or pursuant to the <a href="http://disney.go.com/fairies/pixie-hollow/membership/membership-agreement.html">Pixie Hollow Membership Agreement</a>, 
								each referred to below as "<strong>Account</strong>"), will be referred to as the "<strong>ACCOUNT HOLDER</strong>" in this Agreement, and may not necessarily be the
								PURCHASER.  
							</p>
							<p>
								The terms of this PURCHASE AGREEMENT apply to both PURCHASER and ACCOUNT HOLDER.. The PURCHASER is responsible for making each ACCOUNT HOLDER for whom
								they purchase the Service (and anyone else allowed to access to Accounts) aware of the terms of this PURCHASE AGREEMENT and for ensuring compliance.
								The ACCOUNT HOLDER for an Account is entirely liable for all activities conducted through that registered Pixie Hollow Account. 
							</p>
							<p>
								By purchasing and using this Service, PURCHASER and ACCOUNT HOLDER agree to this PURCHASE AGREEMENT, the Disney Terms of Use 
								- <a href="http://disney.go.com/legal/conditions_of_use.html"><strong>http://disney.go.com/legal/conditions_of_use.html</strong></a>, and the Disney
								House Rules - <a href="http://disney.go.com/guestservices/houserules"><strong>http://disney.go.com/guestservices/houserules</strong></a> (collectively,
								the "<strong>Agreement</strong>").  If you as ACCOUNT HOLDER and/or PURCHASER do not agree to each of these documents in their entirety, please do not
								purchase and/or use the Service.  
							</p>
							<p>
								PURCHASER and ACCOUNT HOLDER will be collectively referred to as "<strong>User</strong>" or "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>" in the
								remainder of this PURCHASE AGREEMENT.
							</p>
							<p>
								We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove (collectively, "<strong>Change</strong>" or the 
								"<strong>Changes</strong>") portions of this Agreement (including the Terms of Use and House Rules) at any time, and Changes will be effective
								immediately upon posting of the revised Agreement at the domain or subdomain where the prior version was posted.  It is the User�s responsibility to
								review these terms, the Terms of Use, and the House Rules for any Changes.  Although notification of Changes to this Agreement may from time to time be
								posted on Pixie Hollow�s web sites or in proximity to the Game, or sent via e-mail or postal mail, such notification does not waive or otherwise excuse
								User�s affirmative obligation to review the Agreement for Changes, and to understand and agree to the most up-to-date terms of the Service.  We suggest
								that you review the terms of this PURCHASE AGREEMENT, the Terms of Use, and the House Rules for Changes each time prior to using the Service.
							</p>
							<p>
								If any future Changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you, or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you must see that the
								Account for which the purchase was made is terminated.  Continued use of the Service following Changes to this Agreement (including the Terms of Use
								and House Rules) will signify that the User accepts those Changes.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may change, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including, without limitation, (a) the availability of any
								Service feature, database or content, hours of availability, or equipment needed to access the Service, and (b) pricing for the Service.  We may also
								impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service for extended periods of time, without notice or liability.  We
								reserve the right to interrupt the Service with or without prior notice for any reason or no reason, and you shall not be entitled to any refunds of
								fees for interruption or discontinuation of the Service or its otherwise failure to perform.  We cannot guarantee that this Service or any data stored
								or transmitted in connection with it will be uninterrupted, error-free, and secure of viruses and other malware.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are not an Internet provider and do not provide Internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with your Internet connection.  You
								are likewise solely responsible for and must provide all telephone, computer and other equipment necessary to access the Service, including without
								limitation Internet access software and modems.  We do not guarantee that the Service will operate on any specific equipment or any particular
								operating system, and we are not responsible for any damage, either temporary or permanent, to equipment or software in connection with using the
								Service.
							</p>
							<h4>RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF MATERIALS</h4>
							<p>
								All materials published by Disney (including, but not limited to, informational resources, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips, and video
								clips (collectively, "<strong>Content</strong>")) are protected by copyright, and owned or controlled by Disney, its parent or affiliated companies, or
								a third-party provider.  You shall abide by all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Service.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Service is copyright protected as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to U.S. copyright laws, international conventions, and other
								copyright laws.  No material from the Service or any Web site owned, operated, licensed, or controlled by Disney may be copied, reproduced,
								republished, uploaded, posted, or transmitted, nor may derivative works be created from them or distributed in any way.  Your use of this Service will
								constitute an affirmative acknowledgment that unauthorized copying of the Software (defined below) or duplication of the Software in any manner,
								including software that has been modified, merged, or included with the Software, or the written materials associated therewith, is expressly
								forbidden.  Using our Content for any other purpose, including but not limited to using any of our Content on any other Web site or networked computer
								environment, is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights and is strictly prohibited.
							</p>
							<p>
								You further acknowledge that you may not sublicense, transfer, sell, or assign this license, the Service, the Software, or your username, Pixie Hollow
								fairy/sparrowman name, or Account ID.  Any attempt to sublicense, transfer, auction, sell or assign the license is void, and such attempts, regardless
								of whether made by User, will result in immediate termination of the Account.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you download software from the Service, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data
								accompanying the software (collectively, the "<strong>Software</strong>"), are licensed to you by Disney.  We hereby grant to you a non-exclusive
								license to use the Software solely in connection with the Service via an authorized and fully-paid (or authorized free or trial) Account.  You
								represent, warrant, and covenant (a) that no materials of any kind submitted through your use of the Account and use/purchase of the Service will (i)
								violate, plagiarize, or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, or other personal or proprietary rights;
								or (ii) contain libelous or otherwise unlawful material; (b) the credit card provided to us is valid, PURCHASER is authorized to use the credit card,
								and is at least thirteen (13) years old; (c) we may charge the credit card provided to us, as more fully described in the Section titled "Price and
								Payment" below; and (d) you will fully comply with the terms of the Agreement.
							</p>
							<p>
								You do not own the Account, nor do you own any data stored on our servers.  When using the Service, you may accumulate things, including currency,
								treasures, skills, equipment, and other items, that reside as data on our servers.  You do not own these things, nor do you own the Pixie Diamonds. 
								Rather you receive a limited right to use those things in connection with certain features in the Game, including but not limited to the Service.  All
								Account data may be deleted, altered, moved, or transferred at any time for any reason or no reason at all in Disney's sole and absolute discretion. In
								the event that such data is corrupted, destroyed, or otherwise lost, you acknowledge that Disney shall not be subject to any liability.
							</p>
							<p>
								Without limiting other terms of this Agreement, Disney forbids and does not recognize (i) the transfer of Accounts, or (ii) any agreements to receive
								consideration in return for purchasing or using the Service or any other Pixie Hollow feature/subscription/membership/etc.  In other words, you should
								only purchase the Service for yourself or as a gift for someone else (and expecting nothing in return), and you should not let someone else take over
								your Account.   You may not purchase, sell, gift, or trade an Account, and you shall not purchase, sell, or trade the Service to/from any company or
								individual other than Disney; any such attempts shall be null and void.  Disney only sells the Service, and Pixie Diamonds are not redeemable for any
								sum of money or monetary value from Disney (nor will we provide refunds) or from anyone else.  Per this Agreement, Disney owns, has licensed, or
								otherwise has rights to all of the Content that appears on the Pixie Hollow website and in the Game, and in connection with the Service.  You agree
								that you have no right or title in or to any such Content other than permitted herein, including the virtual goods or currency appearing or originating
								in the Game or in connection with the Service or other feature/subscription/membership/etc, or any other attributes associated with the Account or
								stored in connection wit the Service or other feature/subscription/membership/etc.  Disney does not recognize any agreements to transfer virtual
								property in or outside of the Game, including but not limited to agreements to sell items for "real" money or in exchange for other items.
							</p>
							<p>
								You hereby indemnify, defend, and hold Disney, its parent and affiliated companies, and all officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers,
								affiliates, licensers, and licensees (collectively, the "<strong>Indemnified Parties</strong>") harmless from and against any and all liability and
								costs incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you or any user of your Account.
							</p>
							<p>
								You further acknowledge and agree that we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, track, record, observe or follow any and all of your interactions
								within the Service.
							</p>
							<h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>
							<p>
								THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE
								PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, DISNEY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
								AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT
								DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. DISNEY DOES NOT
								WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS,
								ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. YOU (AND NOT DISNEY) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. APPLICABLE LAW MAY
								NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
							</p>
							<p>
								WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, AS A SERVICE TO USERS OF THE DISNEY SERVICE, WE INCLUDE LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES ON THE
								WORLD WIDE WEB PORTION OF THE INTERNET AND THAT DISNEY HAS NO CONTROL OVER, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, REGARDING THE CONTENT
								OR APPROPRIATENESS OF CONTENT ON SUCH WEB SITES, AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST US WITH RESPECT TO SUCH WEB SITES.
							</p>
							<p>
								Further, Disney explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy, content, or availability of information found on sites that link to or from
								the Services from third parties not associated with Disney. Disney encourages discretion when browsing the Internet using our or anyone else's service.
								Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive,
								Disney cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites, and you
								hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. Disney cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services
								that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or from the Service since other shop channels are owned and operated by independent retailers.
								Disney does not endorse any of the merchandise, nor has Disney taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information
								contained in such third-party sites. Disney does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information including, without
								limitation, credit card and other personal information you might be requested to give any third party and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim
								against us with respect to such sites. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding
								with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.
							</p>
							<h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
							<p>
								UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL DISNEY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE
								USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE OR ANY OTHER WEB SITE, EVEN IF DISNEY OR A DISNEY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN
								ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
								DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL DISNEY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND
								CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR
								ACCESSING THE SERVICE.
							</p>
							<h4>SECURITY</h4>
							<p>
								As part of the registration process, Users select a password and Account ID ("<strong>Account ID</strong>"). We reserve the right to delete or change
								your Account ID for any reason or no reason.  You shall provide Disney with accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information.  Failure to do so
								shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your Account or other measures, including legal action.  You
								may not (i) select or use an Account ID of another person with the intent to impersonate that person, including Account IDs that are deliberately
