		<response_0_0>Did you know each Talent Game lets you choose between three different ingredient rewards?</response_0_0>
		<response_0_1>Usually it's a common ingredient, a semi-rare ingredient, and a rare ingredient.</response_0_1>
		<response_1_0>If you ever want to see your own profile, here's what you do...</response_1_0>
		<response_1_1>Just double-click on yourself when you're in a meadow. Super easy!</response_1_1>
		<response_2_0>Hey, pixie pal, how do you like my new house? Pretty flaptastic, huh?</response_2_0>
		<response_2_1>I liked living in Havendish Square, but so many of my critter friends live in this tree, I decided to become a neighbor.</response_2_1>
		<response_2_2>Brrr! It's a bit cold here, though. I think it's time to get some cozy fashions at Gale's Outfitters!</response_2_2>
		<response_3_0>I have a new friend! Can you see her? She's right here! Go on, look for her!</response_3_0>
		<response_3_1>See her yet? She's very, very still. Know why? She's taking a nap!</response_3_1>
		<response_3_2>Do you see her now? Say hello to Camilla Chipmunk!</response_3_2>
		<response_4_0>Oh, I love my new house! It's bigger, it's brighter, and it's got a long hallway so I have room to hang lots of pictures!</response_4_0>
		<response_4_1>And have you ever seen such a beautiful pinecone lamp? Iridessa made it for me. She collected Yellow Gems from The Never Mine and made them glow!</response_4_1>
		<response_4_2>Then she hid them inside the pinecone. Clever, huh? If I wasn't an animal-talent, I think I'd want to be a light-talent!</response_4_2>
		<response_5_0>I wish I could take credit for decorating my new house, but the truth is... well, I'm not very good at it.</response_5_0>
		<response_5_1>Lucky for me there are decoration-talent Fairies like Ruffle. She can make any room look critterific! My job will be to keep it neat and clean.  </response_5_1>
		<response_5_2>Oh dear... I'm not very good at that either...</response_5_2>
		<response_6_0>Have you seen my otter toothbrush? I need to clean the baby otters' teeth today, but I can't find my otter toothbrush!</response_6_0>
		<response_6_1>Ever since I moved here to Evergreen Overlook, I can't find anything! Moving is hard, you know? All my stuff is in new places! I get so confused...</response_6_1>
		<response_6_2>Oh, okay, I'll admit it - I couldn't find anything in my old house either. Rosetta says I'm messy, but I prefer to call it Creative Housekeeping! </response_6_2>
