		<response_0_0>It's not easy caring for baby animals. Even when they're sick, they want to play.</response_0_0>
		<response_0_1>I mean, I must spend half my day playing Find the Patient!</response_0_1>
		<response_10_0>Your Animal Friend has been released to the mainland. Don't forget to visit Beck's Nursery to choose a new Animal Friend to help!</response_10_0>
		<response_1_0>What's my motto, you ask?</response_1_0>
		<response_1_1>A thing of beauty is a joy forever...</response_1_1>
		<response_1_2>...but an animal that has been healed is a FRIEND forever!</response_1_2>
		<response_2_0>I like to start each day by playing with the animals in Beck's Animal Nursery. It's so much fun!</response_2_0>
		<response_2_1>I like to play Catch Me best, but I know what the animals' favorite game is...</response_2_1>
		<response_2_2>...Tickle Elixa!</response_2_2>
		<response_3_0>I guess you could say I'm like a tinker-talent -- I FIX things!</response_3_0>
		<response_3_1>But the things I fix thank me afterwards with sweet smiles and sloppy critter kisses.</response_3_1>
		<response_3_2>I wouldn't have it any other way!</response_3_2>
		<response_4_0>Don't worry, your Animal Friend will get sick less often as they grow older!</response_4_0>

		<response_5_2>Hm, no wonder there is a friendly rivalry between Fireflies and Bees!</response_5_2>
		<response_6_0>Animal Friends love to play games with Fairies -- it helps them practice their skills!</response_6_0>
		<response_7_0>Be sure to help your Animal Friend train by playing games with them as often as you can!</response_7_0>
		<response_8_0>I see you want to release your Animal Friend.</response_8_0>
		<response_8_1>Remember, once you release them to the mainland, they will NOT come back to Pixie Hollow.</response_8_1>
		<response_9_0>I see your Animal Friend has grown. It looks like it's in tip top shape!</response_9_0>
		<response_9_1>Remember, once you release them to the mainland, they will NOT come back to Pixie Hollow.</response_9_1>
