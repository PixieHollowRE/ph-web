		<response_0_0>I really love playing jokes on my pals. </response_0_0>
		<response_0_1>Once I used pixie dust to cover Iridessa with green and blue spots! It was hilarious!</response_0_1>
		<response_0_2>Well, it was hilarious until she noticed...</response_0_2>
		<response_10_0>A little bird told me that lots of Fairies are playing the game "rock, paper, scissors" in the meadows. </response_10_0>
		<response_10_1>I'll have to try it out sometime!</response_10_1>
		<response_11_0>Oh, sufferin' stink bugs, there's another hole in my shirt. I am SO hard on clothes, but hey -- I'm an animal-talent!</response_11_0>
		<response_11_1>Guess I need to go to one of the Tailoring Nooks to make a new top. Maybe I should make an extra one, too, just in case!</response_11_1>
		<response_12_0>You know what I like best about being an animal-talent? I get to feed the animals. And comb their fur. And teach them to fly or burrow or hop or crawl. And, well -- everything!</response_12_0>
		<response_12_1>Hmm. Guess I just like being around animals!</response_12_1>
		<response_13_0>Did you know that animal-talents can't talk to butterflies? It's true! We can talk to all other animals, but NOT to butterflies.</response_13_0>
		<response_13_1>Butterflies are, like, the ultimate practical jokers. Oh, they like to cause trouble!</response_13_1>
		<response_13_2>Personally, I think they're a crack-up!</response_13_2>
		<response_1_0>I love being an animal-talent!</response_1_0>
		<response_1_1>There's nothing better than chatting with a beaver or taking a nap on the big furry belly of a friendly chipmunk!</response_1_1>
		<response_2_0>If you could see my wardrobe, you'd know what my favorite colors are -- earthy colors!</response_2_0>
		<response_2_1>Foxtail Orange, Bark Brown, and Strawberry Red are my favorite dyes!</response_2_1>
		<response_2_2>And you know what the best part is? When I wear these colors, it's hard for anybody to tell when I've been playing with the critters in the dirt!</response_2_2>
		<response_3_0>I'm not a fast-flying-talent like Vidia, but I can still fly with the birds around Pixie Hollow!</response_3_0>
		<response_3_1>It's hard to beat the thrill of doing loop-de-loops with a Crispwing Robin!</response_3_1>
		<response_4_0>I don't have a favorite animal. I like ALL animals!</response_4_0>
		<response_4_1>But I guess I do have a thing for babies -- baby squirrels, baby spiders, baby anything!</response_4_1>
		<response_4_2>They got those big eyes, and they're so fuzzy and cute and -- okay, I'll stop now.</response_4_2>
		<response_5_0>Me, clean? Me, neat? Oh, hardee-har! I am so NOT the neat and clean type.</response_5_0>
		<response_5_1>That's not to say I'm a slob. But being an animal-talent, I have to get down and dusty with the critters!</response_5_1>
		<response_6_0>Sometimes it's hard to find berries in Pixie Hollow. </response_6_0>
		<response_6_1>If you ever need some, I have plenty to share.</response_6_1>
		<response_6_2>Just lend a wing in Knothole Pantry sorting food for the animals. I can always use the help!</response_6_2>
		<response_7_0>Oh! Oh, I have a great joke! Ready?</response_7_0>
		<response_7_1>What did the flower say to the bee? Give up?</response_7_1>
		<response_7_2>"Hello, Honey!"</response_7_2>
		<response_7_3>Heehee! Get it? Honey, Honey? HELLO, HONEY?!? HAHAHAHA! That's animal-talent humor!</response_7_3>
		<response_8_0>I have a riddle for you!</response_8_0>
		<response_8_1>Why did the duck fly upside down? </response_8_1>
		<response_8_2>Give up?</response_8_2>
		<response_8_3>So he could QUACK up!</response_8_3>
		<response_9_0>The cooking-talents always say, "You are what you eat!"</response_9_0>
		<response_9_1>Well then, I must be one lucky Fairy!</response_9_1>
		<response_9_2>I eat a LOT of Four-Leaf Clover Salad!</response_9_2>
