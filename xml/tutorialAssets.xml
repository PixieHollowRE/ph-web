		<tearoomGames2>At least two players are required for both games, but as many as four can play Crazy Cakes.</tearoomGames2>
		<tearoomGames3>The object of Crazy Cakes is to be the first player to get rid of all cards by playing them. To play cards match a color or number to what was last played. &quot;Action Cards&quot; can be used to 'Skip' a player's turn, 'Reverse' the direction of turns, or force others to draw cards.</tearoomGames3>
		<tearoomGames4>&quot;Special Cards&quot; can be played at anytime. The '8' allows a player to change the color of the next card and the &quot;Pixie Power&quot; card activates a special spinner that determines what action will be played next.</tearoomGames4>
		<tearoomGames5>The object of Two for Tea is to score more points than the other player. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time and score points by revealing a pair of matching cards.</tearoomGames5>
		<tearoomGames6>For each match you make you are able to take another turn. If you do not turn over a match, you lose a turn. The game continues until all cards are collected or both players have exceeded the limit of turns.</tearoomGames6>
		<tearoomGames7>The Two for Tea deck often has surprising cards within it that will give you extra points, &quot;Spinner Cards&quot; which activate a spinner that determines what happens next, or even &quot;Treat Cards&quot; that add items to your Pouch.</tearoomGames7>

		<animalFriend1>Visit Beck's Animal Nursery in Springtime Orchard to choose a baby animal that you can care for. They all have their own unique features, so try them all! Remember that caring for an animal is a big responsibility.</animalFriend1>
		<animalFriend2>Baby Animal Friends need constant care so they can grow up to be strong adults. You have to feed them, play with them and heal them when they are sick.</animalFriend2>
		<animalFriend3>When your Animal Friend is sick, visit Elixa's Hospital in Neverberry Thicket. Elixa is a healing-talent and knows how to help animals of all shapes and sizes. She will tell you what to do to heal your Animal Friend.</animalFriend3>
		<animalFriend4>You can view your Animal Friend's profile by clicking on them. The profile is where you can feed your Animal Friend and check on their current status. Be sure to check on your Animal Friend each day.</animalFriend4>

		<animalFriend6>Your Animal Friend has 10 different growth levels: Hatchling, Baby, Tot, Youngling, Youngster, Kiddie, Kid, Teen, Grownup and Full Grown.</animalFriend6>
		<animalFriend7>As your Animal Friend grows older, they will learn Tricks that they can perform. To perform a trick, simply say the Trick's name out loud by typing it with SpeedChat Plus or using the SpeedChat menu. For example, say "Shake!" and your Animal Friend will shake!</animalFriend7>
		<animalFriend8>If you want a different Animal Friend, speak to Elixa to release your current Animal Friend to the mainland. You will NOT be able to get that Animal back again!</animalFriend8>
		<animalFriend9>Butterflies are NOT Animal Friends, as they are far too independent. If you see a Butterfly following a Fairy or Sparrow Man, it means that player has a Clickables Tag-Along following them.</animalFriend9>
		<animalFriend10>To get a gift from your Animal Friend, be sure its Hunger, Health and Mood are all over 90. It must also be following you in the meadow. Animal Friends can bring you up to two gifts a day, and they will bring you better gifts as they get older!</animalFriend10>
