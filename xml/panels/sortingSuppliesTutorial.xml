		<tutorial_stepIntro>Welcome to the Sorting Station! Let me show you how to sort the Lost Things.</tutorial_stepIntro>
		<tutorial_step1>First, pick up a Lost Thing.</tutorial_step1>
		<tutorial_step2>Now drop the Lost Thing into the right basket!</tutorial_step2>
		<tutorial_step3>Careful how you toss them into the baskets! Lost Things can be pretty bouncy.</tutorial_step3>
		<tutorial_step3B>Now it's your turn!</tutorial_step3B>
		<tutorial_step4>Flitterific!</tutorial_step4>
		<tutorial_step5>Watch this sorting meter. It goes down if you put a Lost Thing in the wrong basket. Do that too many times and you'll have to start over.</tutorial_step5>
		<tutorial_step6>This widget shows you how many times you've sorted Lost Things correctly. And this one shows you how many you need to collect.</tutorial_step6>
		<tutorial_step7>This doohickey here shows you how many chances you have left. Don't worry, I'll be here if you need me!</tutorial_step7>
		<!--<tutorial_step8>There are lots of different kinds of lost things and we need to get them all sorted. Want to try to get them in the baskets where they belong? Try it out.</tutorial_step8>

		<instruction0>To pick up a Lost Thing click on it and hold the button down.</instruction0>
		<instruction1>Now drag and drop the Lost Thing into the right basket.</instruction1>
		<instruction2>Be careful how you toss - Lost Things can get awfully bouncy!</instruction2>
		<instruction3>Watch your sorting meter! When you sort incorrectly, the meter goes down. If you sort too many things into the wrong basket, the game is over.</instruction3>

		<tinkGood0>Flitterific!</tinkGood0>
		<tinkGood1>You've got some serious sorting skills!</tinkGood1>
		<tinkGood2>You're a superb sorter!</tinkGood2>
		<tinkGood3>Look at you go! Keep flying!</tinkGood3>
		<tinkGood4>I've never seen anybody flit so fast!</tinkGood4>

		<tinkBad2>Hey, your sorting is getting sloppy!</tinkBad2>
		
		<interlevel1>Welcome to the Sorting Station! I need your help to sort out a bunch of my Lost Things. As the Lost Things move down the conveyor belt, grab them fast and put them in the right basket! Ready to sort? Okay, let's fly!</interlevel1>
		<interlevel8>Oh, look! Now some of the baskets can hold two items!</interlevel8>
		<interlevel11>Great job! But a Tinker's work is never done!</interlevel11>
		<interlevel16>Did you know that if you hold on to a Lost Thing, you can use it to bounce other Lost Things into baskets?</interlevel16>

		<interlevel20>That was great - but we've got a lot more to sort! Let's keep going!</interlevel20>
		<interlevel26>Terrific job! But watch out! The Lost Things are starting to come out faster!</interlevel26>

		
		<interLevelTitle1>Welcome</interLevelTitle1>
		<interLevelTitle8>Get Ready!</interLevelTitle8>

		<gameWin0>Wow, thanks for helping me sort all that out! Big job, huh? But come back again soon -- I'm always finding more Lost Things! And now for your reward...</gameWin0>
		<gameLose0>Whoa! It looks like things got a little disorganized! No problem - you can come back anytime and help! Thanks again!</gameLose0>

		<levelLose0>Eeep! Things are getting all mixed up! Try it again, hurry!</levelLose0>
		<levelLose1>Those Lost Things sure pile up fast! Why don't we try that again?</levelLose1>
