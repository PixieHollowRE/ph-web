		<response_0_0>"There's no place like home." That's what some folks on the mainland say.</response_0_0>
		<response_0_1>Others say that "home is where your heart is." And some others think that "home is where you hang your hat."</response_0_1>
		<response_0_2>Me? I'm a "home sweet home" kind of guy. Yup, there's nothing better than a nice home to fly to at the end of a long day.</response_0_2>
		<response_1_0>I love it when I'm home alone and there's a storm outside.</response_1_0>
		<response_1_1>Thunder may flash, lightning may crash, rain may fall and wind may howl, but I love it!</response_1_1>
		<response_1_2>Because I'm safe and warm in my home!</response_1_2>
