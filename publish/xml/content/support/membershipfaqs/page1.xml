<br /><br />For example, if you purchase a Membership on the first day of a month, and then cancelled your Membership before or on the fifteenth day of that month, you will receive a full refund, but your Membership will expire immediately. If you cancel after the sixteenth day of that month, you will be charged for the remainder of that subscription period and your Membership will automatically expire on the first day of the following month. 
<br /><br />However, please note that if you cancel online, you will not be refunded for the current subscription period and your account will revert to non-Member status at the end of that paid subscription period.<br /><br />
